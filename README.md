# Recurrent-neural-network---radio-signal
Cosmic rays can be measured with antennas using the emitted radio signal. However, one has to discriminate the real signal from background noise (human made noise, galactic noise etc.). We will train a recurrent neural network to identify whether a radio trace contains a cosmic ray radio signal.
