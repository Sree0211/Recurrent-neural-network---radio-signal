# Recurrent-neural-network: radio-signal
Cosmic rays can be measured with antennas using the emitted radio signal. However, one has to discriminate the real signal from background noise (human made noise, galactic noise etc.). We will train a recurrent neural network to identify whether a radio trace contains a cosmic ray radio signal.


We load the data from https://drive.google.com/u/0/uc?export=download&confirm=HgGH&id=1R-qfxO1jVh88TC9Gnm9JGMomSRg0Zpkx and visualize it, so one can see the difference between
pure noise and signal traces.
